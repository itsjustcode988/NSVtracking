## NSV Live: Real-Time Network Survey Visualization

**Challenge:** Develop a mobile application enabling real-time visualization of Network Survey Vehicle (NSV) reports during field inspections.

---

## Objective

Create a cross-platform (iOS/Android) app that:

1.  **Visualizes NSV data in real-time** (e.g., signal strength, coverage maps, infrastructure defects) during site surveys.
2.  **Enables immediate decision-making** for field engineers and remote teams.

## Key Requirements

### Functional

* **Live Data Integration:**
    * Sync with NSV sensors (GPS, signal scanners, cameras) via Bluetooth/5G.
    * Stream data with <500ms latency.
* **Dynamic Map Visualization:**
    * Overlay real-time metrics (e.g., signal heatmaps, network coverage gaps) on an interactive GIS map (e.g., Mapbox).
    * Tag defects (e.g., broken towers, cable damage) with photos/coordinates.
* **Collaboration Tools:**
    * Live chat/annotation for field engineers and remote experts.
    * Push alerts for critical anomalies (e.g., "Signal drop at Tower A12").
* **Offline Mode:**
    * Cache data when connectivity is poor; auto-sync when restored.

### Non-Functional

* **Performance:** Render visualizations at 60fps on mid-tier devices.
* **Security:** AES-256 encryption for data transmission/storage.
* **Usability:** Accessible in direct sunlight (high-contrast UI) and glove-friendly touch controls.

---

## Technical Constraints

* **Backend:** Use lightweight protocols (MQTT/WebSockets) for data streaming.
* **Frontend:** React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
* **Data Sources:** Mock NSV APIs (sample JSON/WebSocket endpoints will be provided).
* **No cloud dependency:** Edge-computing for latency-critical processing.

---

## Deliverables

1.  **Prototype:**
    * Clickable Figma/Adobe XD mockups OR a minimal viable app (APK/IPA).
    * Core screens: Live map, report dashboard, anomaly alerts.
2.  **Concept Pitch (5 min max):**
    * Explain:
        * Data flow architecture (NSV → App → Cloud).
        * How real-time visualization reduces inspection time.
        * Scalability to 100+ concurrent users.

---

## Success Metrics

* **Efficiency:** Cut report generation time by $\ge$70% vs. manual methods.
* **Accuracy:** Achieve $\ge$95% real-time data-to-visual consistency.
* **Usability:** Score $\ge$4.5/5 in field-user testing (task completion rate).

## Example Use Case

**Field Scenario:** An engineer inspects a telecom tower. The app shows a **live heatmap** revealing a coverage gap. They snap a photo of a damaged antenna, tag it on the map, and notify the control room. Remote experts annotate the image with repair instructions. All data auto-generates a PDF report post-inspection.
